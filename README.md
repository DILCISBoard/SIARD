SIARD (Software Independent Archiving of Relational Databases) - an open file format for the long-term archiving of relational databases

Here you will find the SIARD specifications along with XML schemas and examples (as files).

You will also find the recommendation for the SIARD 2.0 feature of storing large objects outside the SIARD archive file along with examples.

SIARD (Software Independent Archival of Relational Databases) is a format used in preservation of relational databases 

The SIARD format is based on standards including the ISO standards Unicode, XML, and SQL, the URI Internet standard, and the industry standard ZIP.
The aim of employing internationally recognised standards is to ensure the long-term preservation of, and access to, the widely used relational database model, as well as easy exchange of database content, independent of proprietary “dump” formats.

The SIARD 2.0 format is an extension of the standard eCH-0165 for the SIARD 1.0 format.

SIARD 1.0 was developed in 2008 by the Swiss Federal Archives and has been a Swiss standard since 2013 ([eCH-0165](http://www.bar.admin.ch/dienstleistungen/00823/01911/index.html?lang=en&download=NHzLpZeg7t,lnp6I0NTU042l2Z6ln1ad1IZn4Z2qZpnO2Yuq2Z6gpJCDeIN,gGym162epYbg2c_JjKbNoKSn6A--)).

SIARD 2.0 was developed in 2015 by the Swiss Federal Archives and the [EARK project](http://www.eark-project.com/)
