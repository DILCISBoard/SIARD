# Request For Comments on SIARD 2.2

More information: [https://dilcis.eu/reviews/current-reviews](https://dilcis.eu/reviews/current-reviews)

The SIARD file format version 2.2 Request for Comments is based on SIARD 2.1.1 and is strictly focused on what is needed to ensure scalability, esp. handling large objects outside the SIARD file according to SQL:2008, chapter 9 SQL/MED. 
SIARD 2.2 should be fully backward compatible with SIARD 2.1.1.

All other requests for change, be it additions, replacements or removals to the SIARD File format specification have been ignored and postponed to the next revision, which we expect will come soon after this, led by the DILCIS Board.


We urge all current and coming users of SIARD to give their comments to this Request for Commons version 2.2 of SIARD. And those being part of the process of creating this RFC should hold themselves back from commenting again.

Having received these comments the DILCIS Board will modify the specifications and issue a new version of SIARD named SIARD 2.2.
